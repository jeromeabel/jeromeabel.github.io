This project is the nÂ°13 of the OpenClassrooms Front-End learning path. 

## Context
I work at the Remede Agency, a web agency. We are developing a full-stack app for a new bank company, ArgentBank

## Tasks
The backend is provided with a tiny data set of two users. My goals are :
- Build a responsive React App with three pages : home, signup and profile according to previous designs
- Add an authentication system with Redux
- Document the API with Swagger : phase 2 transactions

## Stack
- React
- React-router
- Redux-toolkit
- RTK-query
