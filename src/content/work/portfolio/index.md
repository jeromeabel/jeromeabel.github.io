## History

Since 2004, I have shared my work on the Web. A portfolio site is always an opportunity to test new techniques:

- 2004 - abel.jerome.free.fr: Flash Action Script
- 2012 - jeromeabel.net v1: PHP Ionize CMS, Blueprint CSS framework
- 2018 - jeromeabel.net v2: Lektor SSG, Jinja template, W3CSS framework, JS slider
- 2021 - jeromeabel.net v3: Hugo SSG, Tachyons CSS, JS lazy and scroll
- 2023 - dev.jeromeabel.net v1: Astro SSG, Tailwind CSS, JS intersection observer

## The problem

As part of my job search, I need a showcase site focused on web development:

- The github account doesn't seem to be enough to stand out from other candidates
- My art website doesn't reflect my new journey into the web development. It could be confusing.
- This should make employers want to meet me
- This should convince other developers to work with me or make interesting connections

## The solution

- Create a unique visual identity with Inkscape
- Provide a great user experience with CSS animations and assets loading
- Build a high quality website: performance, SEO, Accessibility
- Share useful content about my works
- Experiment the Astro Framework

### Unique visual identity

![Portfolio Visual Identity](./identity.jpg)

The research on visual identity came from an [artistic experience](https://jeromeabel.net/workshop/metre/) where I took the dimension of my body 1 meter from the ground to construct objects. In real life, these shapes honestly aren't very interesting, but I still thought it might be a good start for creating visuals for my site.

From there was also born the idea of showing material in a vector drawing: shadows, noises, dotted lines. I wanted to show the idea that my developer profile is not "flat", that it brings you relief in projects and connections between different points of view

### High quality

A lot of optimizations have been made to get those great results:

- Font loading
- Responsive images, LQIP placeholder
- Reduce motion
- .htaccess file on Apache server
- Semantic HTML
- ...
