The LFO is the Fablab of Friche Belle de Mai in Marseille. It opened its doors in November 2013. This project gives substance and synthesizes the educational, artistic and socio-cultural mode of action to which we have been attached since the creation of the Reso-nance Numérique association.

## Web features

![PHP](./php.jpg)

- PHP: get data from the RSS feed of our wordpress website and display featured projects on another website
- PHP/AJAX/SQLITE/BOOTSTRAP: a webform to manage projects with our community
- HTML/CSS: onepage websites for side projects like http://malinette.info

## Python with Blender

![Python](./python.jpg)

“[Méta Cristal](https://reso-nance.org/meta-cristal/)” is an interactive and immersive installation inviting spectators to play with the codes and aesthetics of Marvel and DC Comics comics. Several scenes are offered around a magic crystal. The crystal physically emerges from the screen as an interface between the imaginary world of superheroes and the real world. A story emerges between the spectators and the crystal. This gives them a superpower, that of acting on elements of the decor with their movements.

- I've developed a scene manager in Python for Blender
- I wrote a technical article about it: [Python with Blender Game Engine](https://reso-nance.org/wiki/logiciels/blender/bge-python/accueil)

## XBee

XBee modules are a solution for transmitting data wirelessly, by radio waves. We were trying to use it on wireless projects.

- I wrote a technical article on XBee: [XBee - wiki](http://reso-nance.org/wiki/materiel/xbee/accueil)

## Workshops
