The graphical interface is based on the fantastic Pure Data language and the work of its community. It is released under three different flavors, from newbies to experts.

We design a wood box shaped like a book to make it portable. It contains an electronic board Arduino and a coherent set of five sensors and five actuators. You can be build the box in a Fablab near you.
