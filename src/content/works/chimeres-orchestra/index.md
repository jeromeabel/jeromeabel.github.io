Our cities are made up of materials, surfaces and textures which vibrate and produce possibilities for aesthetic and musical intervention. What would happen if we could play these surfaces and hear their shapes and sounds? What if across our cities musical robots played upon these surfaces, turning the city into a live automatic orchestra ?

Shaped like insects, Chimères Orchestra is a robotic sound installation, which is attached to metallic structures around the city. As a group, these robotic instruments form a tribe or family, and when organised together play rhythms using their spidery arms. Their sounds resonate through space, calling to passers-by, disrupting their rhythm and walk; they invite us to hit, play and explore the physicality of our urban surfaces.
