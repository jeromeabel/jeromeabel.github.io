As a software developer, my main job is to create an application tailored to the user's needs. It is not an easy task !

To provide the best user experience, I appreciate all kinds of interactions and movements in the life of the project.

This surely comes with a certain feeling of accessibility, because the user can be anyone. And that's the beauty: User-centered development can be human-centered.
