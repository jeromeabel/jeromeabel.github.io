I seek to create optimal quality software. This is accompanied by the pragmatic completion of many tasks such as naming, refactoring, low coupling, high cohesion, testing and maintainability.

As we work as a team, this helps create a common culture as well as a good developer experience. The code is thus malleable to future changes of scale or additions of functionalities.

I seek to constantly improve on this point, particularly through my learning of Design Patterns, Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design.
