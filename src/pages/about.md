I am a web developer and multimedia artist. This transversal approach gives birth to beautiful fruits 🍇 (seasonal of course), sometimes new 🌟!

These two aspects are complementary 🤝:

- 🎨 Some artistic notions are useful in software development such as prototyping, exploring new ideas, "out of the box" problem-solving, message synthesis, production and distribution constraints, and enrichment of user experience;
- 💻 Similarly, computer studies bring, among other things, humility, information management, organization of time and tasks, design and modeling of a problem, algorithms and simply a finer knowledge of digital matter.

🎓 "Padawan" in web development, I am about to complete my Front-End JS/React software developer training offered by @OpenClassrooms.

🌱 I continue to consolidate Front-End techniques and needs modeling. And I want to develop new branches around "Critical Thinking", "TDD", "Node" and "ThreeJS".
