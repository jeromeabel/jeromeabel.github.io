        It can provide unique and multidimensional experiences, resonating with
        our feelings, perceptions and thoughts. That's why I've been working in
        software arts for over 10 years, exploring embedded systems, creative
        frameworks, and a dozen programming languages. My artistic projects have
        been exhibited in Brussels, Dakar, Montreal, Dubrovnik, Neuss, Tunis,
        Dublin, Paris and more. It was a lot of fun with nice people! If this
        side interests you, consider visiting my artistic projects on
        jeromeabel.net.

        Today, I am fully launching into the field of web development with a
        first specialty in front-end. I just finished a year-long learning
        program at OpenClassrooms, where I learned all the modern tools for
        creating modern, responsive websites: learning skills, writing technical
        specifications, CSS, Sass, creating prototypes in Figma, writing unit
        and integration tests, modern JavaScript and design patterns, making web
        apps with React and Redux.
      </p>

      <p>
        I look forward to growing in this field and meeting brilliant people and
        engineers!
